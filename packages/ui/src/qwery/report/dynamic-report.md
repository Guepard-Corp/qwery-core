# Q4 2024 Sales Performance

## Executive Summary

Our Q4 performance exceeded expectations with total revenue reaching $2.4M, representing a 23% increase over Q3. The growth was primarily driven by enterprise customers in the technology sector.

## Monthly Revenue Trends

The following chart shows our monthly revenue progression throughout Q4:
```js
const monthlyRevenue = await extension.query(`
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
    SUM(amount) as revenue
  FROM sales
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-10-01' 
    AND order_date < '2025-01-01'
  GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
  ORDER BY month
`);

display(vegaLite({
  data: { values: monthlyRevenue },
  mark: 'bar',
  encoding: {
    x: {
      field: 'month',
      type: 'temporal',
      title: 'Month'
    },
    y: {
      field: 'revenue',
      type: 'quantitative',
      title: 'Revenue (USD)',
      axis: { format: '$,.0f' }
    }
  },
  width: 600,
  height: 300
}));
```

November showed the strongest performance with $850K in revenue, though December saw a slight dip likely due to holiday seasonality.

## Customer Segmentation

Breaking down our revenue by customer segment reveals interesting patterns:
```js
const segmentRevenue = await extension.query(`
  SELECT 
    c.segment,
    SUM(s.amount) as revenue
  FROM sales s
  JOIN customers c ON s.customer_id = c.id
  WHERE s.order_date >= '2024-10-01' 
    AND s.order_date < '2025-01-01'
  GROUP BY c.segment
  ORDER BY revenue DESC
`, { engine: 'postgres' });

display(vegaLite({
  data: { values: segmentRevenue },
  mark: 'arc',
  encoding: {
    theta: {
      field: 'revenue',
      type: 'quantitative'
    },
    color: {
      field: 'segment',
      type: 'nominal',
      title: 'Customer Segment',
      scale: {
        domain: ['Enterprise', 'Mid-Market', 'SMB'],
        range: ['#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e', '#2ca02c']
      }
    }
  },
  view: { stroke: null },
  width: 400,
  height: 400
}));
```

Enterprise customers now represent 50% of our total revenue, up from 42% in Q3.

## Top Performing Products
```js
const topProducts = await extension.query(`
  SELECT 
    product_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as orders,
    SUM(amount) as revenue
  FROM sales
  WHERE order_date >= '2024-10-01'
  GROUP BY product_name
  ORDER BY revenue DESC
  LIMIT 10
`);

display(vegaLite({
  data: { values: topProducts },
  mark: 'bar',
  encoding: {
    y: {
      field: 'product_name',
      type: 'nominal',
      title: 'Product',
      sort: '-x'
    },
    x: {
      field: 'revenue',
      type: 'quantitative',
      title: 'Revenue (USD)',
      axis: { format: '$,.0f' }
    },
    tooltip: [
      { field: 'product_name', title: 'Product' },
      { field: 'orders', title: 'Orders' },
      { field: 'revenue', title: 'Revenue', format: '$,.0f' }
    ]
  },
  width: 600,
  height: 400
}));
```

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, we recommend:

1. **Double down on enterprise sales** - The data clearly shows this is our strongest growth segment
2. **Investigate December dip** - Understanding seasonal patterns will help with Q4 2025 planning
3. **SMB retention focus** - While smaller in absolute terms, SMB customers show promise for expansion
