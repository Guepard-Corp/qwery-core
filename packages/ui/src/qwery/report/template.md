# Q4 2024 Sales Performance

## Executive Summary

Our Q4 performance exceeded expectations with total revenue reaching $2.4M, representing a 23% increase over Q3. The growth was primarily driven by enterprise customers in the technology sector.

## Monthly Revenue Trends

The following chart shows our monthly revenue progression throughout Q4:

```vega-lite
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json",
  "data": {
    "values": [
      {"month": "2024-10", "revenue": 720000},
      {"month": "2024-11", "revenue": 850000},
      {"month": "2024-12", "revenue": 830000}
    ]
  },
  "mark": "bar",
  "encoding": {
    "x": {
      "field": "month",
      "type": "temporal",
      "title": "Month"
    },
    "y": {
      "field": "revenue",
      "type": "quantitative",
      "title": "Revenue (USD)"
    }
  },
  "width": 600,
  "height": 300
}
```

November showed the strongest performance with $850K in revenue, though December saw a slight dip likely due to holiday seasonality.

## Customer Segmentation

Breaking down our revenue by customer segment reveals interesting patterns:

```vega-lite
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json",
  "data": {
    "values": [
      {"segment": "Enterprise", "revenue": 1200000},
      {"segment": "Mid-Market", "revenue": 800000},
      {"segment": "SMB", "revenue": 400000}
    ]
  },
  "mark": "arc",
  "encoding": {
    "theta": {
      "field": "revenue",
      "type": "quantitative"
    },
    "color": {
      "field": "segment",
      "type": "nominal",
      "title": "Customer Segment"
    }
  },
  "view": {"stroke": null},
  "width": 400,
  "height": 400
}
```

Enterprise customers now represent 50% of our total revenue, up from 42% in Q3.

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, we recommend:

1. **Double down on enterprise sales** - The data clearly shows this is our strongest growth segment
2. **Investigate December dip** - Understanding seasonal patterns will help with Q4 2025 planning
3. **SMB retention focus** - While smaller in absolute terms, SMB customers show promise for expansion
